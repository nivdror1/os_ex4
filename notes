functions that return errors:

block:: getPartOfBlockContent
block::block
CacheFile::CacheFile

The reason for that behaviour is to "factoring out locality", that means that if we have a
block/file that is very necessary for short period of time, and for any time else we don't mean
to access it again. So with that kind of file, certain block will have very high number of
reference - so it get stuck in the cache for a long time, although no one will access it again.
