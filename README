REMARKS:
These are some remarks that
I want the graders to know
about this submission.

ANSWERS:

part 1:
1) a) round robin:

the gantt chart:
0-2 - p1
2-4 - p2
4-6 - p3
6-8 - p4
8-9 - p5
9-11 - p1
11-12 - p2
12-14 - p4
14-16 - p1
16-18 - p4
18-20 - p1
20-21 - p4
21-23 - p1

turnaround time - 14.2 without cs

average wait time - 9.6 without cs

b) first come first serve:

the gantt chart:
0-10 - p1
10-13 - p2
13-15 - p3
15-22 - p4
22-23 - p1

turnaround time - 16.6 without cs

average wait time - 12 without cs

c) SRTF:

the gantt chart:

0-2 - p1
2-5 - p2
5-7 - p3
7-8 - p5
8-15 - p4
15-23 - p1

turnaround time - 11.6 without cs

average wait time - 3.6 without cs

d) priority scheduling

the gantt chart:

0-10 - p1
10-13 - p2
13-20 - p4
20-22 - p3
22-23 - p5

turnaround time - 17.6 without cs

average wait time - 13 without cs

e) priority scheduling with preemption:

the gantt chart:
0-2 - p1
2-5 - p2
5-12 - p4
12-14 - p3
14-22 - p1
22-23 - p5

turnaround time - 15.2 without cs

average wait time - 7.2 without cs

2) yes, it always provide a faster access time than fetching
from the disk because the heap is located at the main memory.
the main memory is DRAM and therefore accessing DRAM is much faster
then accessing the disk which must be accessed mechanically.
